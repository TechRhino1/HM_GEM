"""
JARVIS AI 4.0 — Canonical Exit Policy.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for every trade-exit decision in the system.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Historically the exit rules were re-implemented in at least three places with
divergent constants and semantics:

  * ``jarvis/backtesting/engine.py``      -> be_trigger_r, fast_cash_r, runner_trail_atr
  * ``jarvis/execution/position_monitor.py`` -> STAGE1/2/3 + STD ATR triggers
  * ``jarvis/execution/order_manager.py``    -> its own duplicate of the same stages

Because they drifted apart, the backtest could never reproduce live behaviour, and
parameters computed upstream (e.g. ``runner_trail_distance_atr`` from the entry
engine) were written into the trade plan but never read by the exit logic.

This module centralises the arithmetic. Both the backtester and the live position
monitor import :func:`evaluate_exit` and therefore cannot disagree.

DESIGN CONTRACT
---------------
``evaluate_exit`` is a *pure* function: given the current trade state and the
observed bar/price, it returns the new stop-loss and (optionally) a partial-close
instruction. It performs no I/O and mutates nothing, which makes it trivially
testable and safe to call from either an event loop or a live monitoring thread.

All thresholds are expressed in R-multiples (multiples of the initial risk
distance ``|entry - initial_sl|``) because R is the only scale-free unit that is
comparable across gold, FX, indices and crypto. ATR is used solely for the
*trailing distance*, where a volatility-relative width is genuinely desirable.

UNIT DISCIPLINE
---------------
``risk_dist`` is a PRICE DISTANCE, not pips. Any function receiving ``profit_dist``
must receive a price distance too. Mixing these was the source of a prior defect
where an ATR multiple was compared against a pip count.
